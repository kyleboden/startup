9/4/24 I learned how to connect GitHub and VS code.
You can find more information in the [Go to README](./README.md).

1. **What does the `link` element do?**
   * The `<link>` element is used in HTML to link external resources, like stylesheets, to an HTML document. It is most commonly used to include CSS files. The syntax looks like this:
      ```html
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   * rel="stylesheet" specifies the relationship between the HTML document and the linked file.
   * href="styles.css" indicates the path to the CSS file.
   * The link element is typically placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document and doesn't produce any visual content on the page itself.

2. What does a div tag do?

  * The `<div>` tag is a block-level element used to group together HTML elements, acting as a container for other content. It does not have any semantic meaning on its own but is commonly used to structure and style sections of a webpage using CSS. For example:
      ```html
      <div class="container">
          <p>This is some text inside a div.</p>
      </div>
  * This div can then be styled or manipulated using CSS or JavaScript.
3. In the following code, what is the difference between the `#title` and `.grid` selector?

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <style>
            #title {
                font-size: 24px;
                color: blue;
            }
    
            .grid {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                gap: 10px;
            }
        </style>
        <title>Selectors Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 id="title">Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
        <div class="grid">
            <div>Item 1</div>
            <div>Item 2</div>
            <div>Item 3</div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

Explanation:
  * #title is an ID selector:

    * It selects the element with the ID attribute title.
    * IDs must be unique within a webpage, so only one element should have this ID.
    * In the example, it targets the `<h1>` element with id="title" and sets its font size to 24px and its color to blue.
  * .grid is a class selector:
  
    * It selects all elements with the class attribute grid.
    * Classes can be reused across multiple elements on the page.
    * In the example, it targets the <div> with class="grid", applying a grid layout with 3 columns and a gap of 10px between grid items.
  Summary:
  
    * ID Selector (#title): Targets a single, unique element. Should be used for elements that appear only once on a page.
    * Class Selector (.grid): Can target multiple elements. It's useful for applying styles to multiple elements that share the same class.
   
4. In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin?

  
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <style>
            .box {
                width: 200px;
                height: 100px;
                background-color: lightblue;
                padding: 20px;
                margin: 30px;
                border: 2px solid blue;
            }
        </style>
        <title>Padding vs. Margin</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="box">This is a box.</div>
    </body>
    </html>

* Padding is the space inside an element, between its content and its border.

  * In the example above, the padding: 20px; adds 20 pixels of space inside the .box element, between the content (This is a box.) and its border.
  * This increases the size of the element because it pushes the border outward.
 
* Margin is the space outside an element, creating distance between the elementâ€™s border and other surrounding elements.
  * In the example above, the margin: 30px; adds 30 pixels of space outside the .box element, separating it from other elements or the edge of the browser window.
  * Margin does not affect the size of the element itself; it just adds space around it.
 
* Padding: Space inside the element, between the content and the border.
* Margin: Space outside the element, creating distance between it and other elements or the page boundary.


4. Given this HTML and this CSS, how will the images be displayed using flex?
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <style>
            .image-container {
                display: flex;
                justify-content: space-around;
                align-items: center;
                height: 300px;
                border: 2px solid black;
            }
    
            .image-container img {
                width: 100px;
                height: auto;
            }
        </style>
        <title>Flexbox Image Display</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
            <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
            <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

  Explanation:
  The .image-container element has display: flex;, which turns it into a flex container. This means all direct children of this container (the <img> elements) are treated as flex items.
  justify-content: space-around; distributes the space around the images. Each image will have equal space on its left and right, creating separation between them within the container.
  align-items: center; vertically centers the images within the height of the container, which is set to 300px.
  Result:
  
  The images will be displayed in a row, as flex containers by default arrange their items in a horizontal line.
  The images will be equally spaced apart due to justify-content: space-around;.
  The images will be vertically centered within the container because of align-items: center;.
  Summary:
  
  Flex Direction: The images are laid out in a row (default flex direction).
  Justification: The images are spaced equally with space on both sides (space-around).
  Alignment: The images are vertically centered within the container (center).
