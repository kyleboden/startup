1. **What does the `link` element do?**

* The `<link>` element is used in HTML to link external resources, like stylesheets, to an HTML document. It is most commonly used to include CSS files. The syntax looks like this:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
* rel="stylesheet" specifies the relationship between the HTML document and the linked file.
* href="styles.css" indicates the path to the CSS file.
* The link element is typically placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document and doesn't produce any visual content on the page itself.
